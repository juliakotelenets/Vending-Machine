Course work in the discipline of "Automation of digital device design"
Develop a control system for the All 30 vending machine.
The machine has the ability to sell one of four drinks (choose the name yourself) at the same price - 30 cents. The machine can accept coins of three denominations - 5, 10 and 25 kopecks. After completing the amount, the machine calculates the balance to be returned and issues the selected product. Deposited funds and the rest must be reflected for the buyer. If there are not enough funds - the signal "Not enough funds" is generated. Initial quantity of goods - 5 copies. After selling the product, the machine reduces its quantity. In the absence of the goods the corresponding message is formed and the paid sum is returned.
